    "body": "<p><span>Today&apos;s <a href='https://www.nthrive.com/solutions/middle/charge-integrity' target='_blank'>Charge Description Master</a> or CDM, which contains pricing and coding for supplies and services provided by a health care organization, truly is foundational for any efficient and effective revenue cycle management program. Keeping the CDM &quot;complete, compliant and transparent&quot; is the key to everything from delivering accurate estimates at patient access, to ensuring charge integrity for <a href='https://www.nthrive.com/solutions/back/claims-and-billing' target='_blank'>claims management</a> and <a href='https://www.nthrive.com/solutions/back/contract-management' target='_blank'>contract management</a>.</span><br></p>\n\n<p>Experts Sherry Nardi, vice president, <a href='https://www.nthrive.com/solutions/' target='_blank'>revenue cycle solutions</a> strategy at nThrive, and David Kelly, director of revenue cycle management at <a href='http://www.maryrutan.org/' target='_blank'>Mary Rutan</a> Hospital in Ohio, talked about the important role of the CDM in their presentation, &quot;Best Practice Charge Description and Compliance,&quot; at the Becker&apos;s Hospital Review CIO/HIT Revenue Cycle Conference on July 27 in Chicago. </p>\n\n<p> <b>Keeping your CDM complete</b></p>\n\n<p>What does a complete CDM look like? Says Nardi, the short answer is that &quot;it should contain every billable service, drug and supply that an organization is making available to patients.&quot; Ultimately, adds Kelly, &quot;it is how you track what you do. Everything is tied to a charge, so it touches every department.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Both emphasize that this information does not stay static. Rather, the CDM is a living document that should be updated on a quarterly basis at minimum. Departments may need to add or remove charges, especially based on &quot;trigger events,&quot; such as new CMS guidelines or payer contract updates.</p>\n\n<p>However, keeping the CDM up-to-date isn&apos;t just about “loading a database full of stuff” that may or may not be applicable over time. It has to reflect the latest regulatory changes and corresponding codes so claims can be processed efficiently.</p>\n\n<p><b>Collaboration is key</b></p>\n\n<p>Because the CDM touches virtually every department, the importance of collaboration cannot be underestimated. “You can&apos;t work in a silo,” Nardi explains, “It has to be a collaborative effort within the organization.”</p>\n\n<p>This means that communication “can&apos;t be one way,” Kelly says. “We have to give the departments information on the impact of compliance and they have to be involved in decisions,” whether it is weighing in on pricing changes, or being judicious with non-reimbursable items.</p>\n\n<p>“I don&apos;t expect a nursing director of the ICU to become a coder,” he explains, “but it is important to understand that, if we put a patient on oxygen, for instance, we don&apos;t get paid separately for tubing, so we don&apos;t want to be wasteful. These are the types of things that can impact people&apos;s behavior.”</p>\n\n<p>Kelly says the CDM also helps him understand clinical flows. “On a complex imaging study, we can&apos;t build charges without knowing how supplies are used. Is there a barium swallow going on where there is a contrast material? How is it used and what does it cost?</p>\n\n<p>“Materials has to get involved,” he explained, “to help us derive defensible pricing and it has to bump up against compliance rules. Can you even charge for the contrast separately? We are also utilizing Contract Manager from nThrive to model whether it is worth it to charge separately.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>How CDM helps transparency</b></p>\n\n<p>Since the CDM is the go-to source for defensible/transparent pricing it is a critical patient access tool when providing estimates for services. “Are you able to define how you came up with a price,” Nardi challenges. </p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, it&apos;s about keeping up with what patients want, which is transparency,” Kelly adds. In this instance, “it&apos;s black and white. If you don&apos;t have a clean CDM you can&apos;t deliver clean prices. Your CDM has to be consistent across departments to generate realistic prices for patients.”</p>\n\n<p>Adds Nardi, “If the CDM is not complete and transparent, and the pricing is not accurate for the line items in question, you could be generating erroneous estimates.”</p>\n\n<p><b>The need for automation</b></p>\n\n<p>For a sole community, independent hospital such as Mary Rutan, having a strong performing revenue cycle is an absolute necessity to help feed the organization&apos;s financial goals and bolster cash flow. To stay on top of today&apos;s rapid influx of change, automating the CDM is an absolute necessity.</p>\n\n<p>Keeping up with regulatory changes and providing for defensible pricing for every component of health system charges is time consuming and complicated. Traditionally health systems have purchased reference books that are outdated before they are shipped. “You need a partner from a software side,” Kelly explains. “When you match CPT with ICD codes there are more than 100,000 codes to manage.” Then you must consider supplies, pharmaceuticals, room charges and OR time that is not counted in these codes. Further, he emphasizes that having access to nThrive&apos;s <a href='http://knowledgesourcepro.com/' target='_blank'>KnowledgeSource</a>® edit set to leverage the data of other facilities is “literally invaluable,” adding “without that I don&apos;t know if I could sleep at night from a compliance standpoint.”</p>\n\n<p> “You are holding up revenue every time a patient&apos;s bill has to come back for rework due to coding or compliance problems resulting from an incomplete or inaccurate CDM,” explains Nardi. In addition to the negative financial impact, she adds that this has a snowball effect, which includes employee unhappiness from having to do a lot of rework.”</p>\n\n<p>To learn how nThrive&apos;s solutions can help improve your revenue cycle and bring more dollars through the door call us today at 678.323.2500.&nbsp;</p>",

    "title": "Blog: Getting paid is a complex problem for today&apos;s health care provider",
    "description": "By Moliehi Weitnauer, nThrive vice president, Claims Management; and, Janett Checo, nThrive principal solutions expert, Claims Management",
    "body": "<p>By Moliehi Weitnauer, nThrive vice president, Claims Management; and, Janett Checo, nThrive principal solutions expert, Claims Management<b></b></p>\n\n<p>While the <a href='http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/about-the-law/index.html' target='_blank'>Affordable Care Act (ACA)</a> has helped to bring approximately nine million newly insured Americans into the health care system, it has also created an unprecedented level of increased complexity for today&apos;s provider. Getting paid means contending with an increasing number of payer offerings versus yesterday&apos;s handful of insurance plans, each bringing a unique set of rules to adhere to. While standardization is certainly part of a longer-term solution, efforts are in their infancy and won&apos;t bring much needed cash through the door in the immediate future.</p><p>The problem is compounded by four key factors: </p><p><!--[if !supportLists]-->1)      <!--[endif]-->Changing regulatory requirements such as the shift to <a href='http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10.htm' target='_blank'>ICD-10</a>, make coding compliance even more difficult. </p><p><!--[if !supportLists]-->2)      <!--[endif]-->Evolving value-based payment models like <a href='https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/cjr' target='_blank'>Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement<b> (</b>CJR<b>)</b></a><b>,</b> require hospitals in designated areas to manage an entire episode of care through a bundled scenario, which is enough to challenge even the best patient accounting system. </p><p><!--[if !supportLists]-->3)      <!--[endif]-->Expanding diversity in care settings creates the need to manage to both acute and professional payer rules, however patient accounting systems lack the content needed to ensure compliance. </p><p><!--[if !supportLists]-->4)      <!--[endif]-->Managing multiple technology applications that are not well integrated makes it difficult to get a bill out on a timely basis. </p><p>Needless to say, sorting through this maze has resulted in a host of billing inefficiencies, with multiple hospital departments often touching a bill before a claim is created and scrubbed for missed errors. This lengthens the time a bill remains in the hospital system and a claim is created, with no guarantee, depending on the quality of the “scrub,” that it will clear when it finally reaches the payer. Worse yet, without good screening your organization could submit a claim twice and trigger a <a href='https://www.nthrive.com/solutions/back/recovery-and-collections' target='_blank'>recovery</a> audit contractor (RAC) visit, resulting in the need to assemble and share three years of claims data for improper payment review. </p><p>The financial impact of denied claims on health care organizations is considerable. In fact, for the average hospital, denials represent 10 percent to 12 percent of total hospital cases.  The magnitude of lost revenue also is alarming.  For instance, if a provider submits $300 million in claims and 10 percent or $30 million are denied, it&apos;s a big revenue hit with more time and staff resources required to resolve the denial issues. Often, when denied claims are reexamined it is a rule change that wasn&apos;t comprehended in the scrub due to incomplete or outdated information. </p><p>How can health care organizations streamline their billing and claims management process to reduce the time a bill lingers in their system and a claim is cleanly submitted for payment? It is important to have access to a thorough, continuously updated edit set higher upstream in your billing process for accelerated claims reconciliation. Embedding such technology into your electronic hospital record (EHR) system can put accurate information at your fingertips, in effect enabling you to do an initial “scrub” to catch and resolve issues earlier on prior to sending claims through a clearinghouse for a final review. In addition, it offers a single repository to make it more efficient to retrieve claims data, in the event of an audit. </p><p>Getting paid requires the ability to provide for claims accuracy and adherence to payer rules. The best way to ensure claims meet requirements for payment is automation of claims screening through robust claims editing technology that covers the acute and professional spectrum. </p><p>nThrive (formerly <a href='https://www.nthrive.com/' target='_blank'>MedAssets-Precyse</a>) ranked #1 in claims management for the “2015/2016 Best in KLAS” report.

    "description": "nThrive&apos;s own Bonnie S. Cassidy, Vice President of Consulting weighs in on ICD-10&apos;s eighth month in action on ICD-10 Monitor's Talk Ten Tuesday podcast. She reflects on what ICD-10&apos;s success can be attributed to and other success factors that have stemmed from its implementation. She begins in saying that success with ICD-10 in the past 8 months results from the internal collaboration of an organization as well as leveraging technology and prep/training for ICD-10. She mentions that it has shown us the connection between clinical documentation integrity to accurate facility and physician coding, profiling, appropriate severity of illness, risk of mortality scores, improved patient safety indicator ratings, proper reimbursement and decreased denials. Whether it be coding, CDI, case management, quality management or risk management, they are all critical success factors to ICD-10 implementation. Bonnie includes that this sheds light on synergy requirements and how we need to keep collaborating and innovating with people process and technology.",

    "title": "Blog: Welcome to nThrive &ndash; A company that meets all of your Patient-to-Payment needs",
    "description": "Joel Hackney, CEO",
    "body": "<p>By Joel Hackney, CEO, nThrive</p><p>You&apos;ve known us as <a href='https://www.nthrive.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>MedAssets</a>, <a href='https://www.nthrive.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Precyse</a> and <a href='http://equationhealth.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Equation</a>. Now I am excited to announce the unveiling of our new, unified identity: nThrive. Bringing our three companies together under a common name completes our vision of a new kind of <a href='https://www.nthrive.com/solutions/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>revenue cycle management</a> company – one that empowers health care for every one in every community. To get there, we believe today&apos;s health care industry needs a robust breadth of competencies, from <a href='http://www.nthrive.com/about-us/patient-to-payment' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Patient-to-Payment</a><sup>&nbsp;</sup>, to seamlessly coordinate financial and clinical care across the enterprise. For the first time ever, nThrive brings true end-to-end resources to the industry to cover this full spectrum of revenue cycle needs. &nbsp;<br></p> <p>What does nThrive mean? It&apos;s all about thriving at the highest level, flourishing to the n<sup>th </sup>degree. In this spirit, we aren&apos;t just talking about making incremental improvements or changes. Our mission is to work side-by-side with clients to transform their financial and operational performance so they are better equipped to care for the communities they serve.</p><p>Embodied within nThrive is what we affectionately call our VMVA, which stands for our vision, mission, values and approach. While a lot of companies may talk about what they stand for, at nThrive, it is more than just words. It is our DNA. Our vision is represented in our name and it carries through to how we market and provide our solutions to our clients, how we hire and develop talent, and where we invest our resources. This is what drives us to help health care reach the next level.</p><p>Unlike the typical “boutique” vendors, consultants or services tied to a payer or provider, we choose to be independent, meaning that we are able to focus on providing <a href='https://www.nthrive.com/solutions/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>solutions</a> that are unbiased and solely aimed at what is best for our clients. Our offering starts by leveraging technology to unify people and processes across the Patient-to-Payment spectrum, with our experts acting as trusted advisors to help integrate revenue cycle functions across the enterprise. Clients also can call on us for outsourcing to create greater efficiencies, and with analytics, we&apos;re equipped to deliver actionable insights that pinpoint strategic areas for improvement. Just as important, we have the education and training programs that health care organizations need to sustain improvement and be competitive. </p><p>Ultimately, our approach produces three very tangible results:</p><p>· First, we help increase revenue capture through a set of technologies and services, ensuring that organizations are fairly paid for the care they provide;</p><p>· Second, we reduce the cost to collect revenue, which reduces operating expenses; and,</p><p>· Third, we accelerate cash flow by improving working capital or reducing aging receivables. We believe all are necessary to help health care create a healthy infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><p><span>As nThrive's CEO, I believe in the power – and the humanity – of helping health care advance. I encourage you to visit </span><span>our </span><span><a href='https://www.nthrive.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>website</a></span><span></span><span>&nbsp;to learn more about how we can help your organization thrive to the n</span><sup>th</sup><span> degree.</span><br></p>",
